**PyVSim**, Python Visualization Simulation is a tool for helping in the set-up of optical measurement systems.

It includes camera models and the possibility of importing CAD models for the calculation of parameters such as field and depth of view.

The physical simulation is written in a generic form, so the project can be adapted for many uses (maybe even 3d scenarios rendering).


## Dependencies ##
  * Numpy
  * Scipy
  * Matplotlib
  * VTK (optional, but recommended)

**Windows users** can install all packages with [python(x,y)](http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) distribution. All development efforts are made to avoid dependencies
outside python(x,y)
